# Running a Single Job or Workflow at a Time Using Concurrency in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides a `concurrency` feature that lets you control how multiple workflow runs or jobs interact with each other. This is especially useful when you want to:

1. Prevent multiple workflow runs from executing simultaneously
2. Cancel previous runs when a new one starts
3. Ensure only one instance of a job runs at a time

## Basic Concurrency Concepts

### Concurrency Groups
You can define concurrency groups using the `concurrency` key in your workflow. All jobs in the same concurrency group will follow the same rules.

### Canceling In-Progress Runs
When using `cancel-in-progress: true`, GitHub will automatically cancel any existing runs in the same concurrency group when a new one starts.


### üìå Purpose:

The `concurrency` keyword in GitHub Actions **ensures that only one instance of a job or workflow runs at a time** based on a unique key.

This is useful when:

* You want to avoid multiple deployments running simultaneously.
* You want the latest workflow run to cancel any previous in-progress ones (like in CI/CD pipelines).

---

## üß† How It Works

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: <unique-key>
  cancel-in-progress: true|false
```

* **`group`**: A string or expression that defines the lock. Workflows sharing the same group key run **one at a time**.
* **`cancel-in-progress`**: If `true`, cancels any currently running job with the same group key before starting the new one.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Workflow at a Time
```yaml
name: Deployment Workflow
on: push

concurrency: 
  group: deployment-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to ${{ github.ref }}"
```

This ensures:
- Only one deployment runs per branch at a time
- If a new push happens while a deployment is running, the previous one gets canceled

### Example 2: Job-Level Concurrency
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency: test-group
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running tests..."
  
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency: build-group
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building artifacts..."
```

This ensures:
- Only one test job runs at a time (all others queue)
- Only one build job runs at a time (all others queue)
- Test and build jobs can run simultaneously with each other

### Example 3: Environment-Specific Concurrency
```yaml
name: Production Deployment
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true

concurrency: 
  group: deploy-${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}"
```

This ensures:
- Only one deployment runs per environment at a time
- If you trigger a new deployment to "production" while one is running, the previous one gets canceled

## üîß Example 1: Single Workflow at a Time (Simple Key)

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

concurrency:
  group: prod-deploy
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print
        run: echo "Deploying application..."
```

üìù This ensures that **only one deployment to production runs at any time**.

---

## üîß Example 2: One Job Per Branch (Dynamic Group Key)

```yaml
name: Branch-Based Build Lock

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev

concurrency:
  group: build-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running build for ${{ github.ref }}"
```

üìù This ensures:

* Builds on the **same branch** run one at a time.
* Builds on **different branches** can run in parallel.

---



## When to Use Concurrency

1. **Deployments**: Prevent multiple simultaneous deployments to the same environment
2. **Scheduled Jobs**: Prevent overlapping runs of scheduled jobs
3. **Resource-Intensive Jobs**: Limit concurrent executions of jobs that share resources
4. **Sequential Processing**: Ensure jobs run in sequence rather than parallel
