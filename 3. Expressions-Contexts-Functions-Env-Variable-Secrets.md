# GitHub Actions: Expressions and Contexts Explained

GitHub Actions provides powerful features for dynamic workflow control through expressions and contexts. These allow you to evaluate conditions, access runtime information, and make decisions in your workflows.

## Reference Links
- [Expressions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/evaluate-expressions-in-workflows-and-actions)
- [Contexts Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/accessing-contextual-information-about-workflow-runs)

## Understanding Expressions

Expressions are evaluated at runtime and can be used to:
- Set environment variables
- Determine job/skip conditions
- Pass values between steps
- Make decisions in your workflow

### Basic Expression Syntax

```yaml
${{ <expression> }}
```

## Common Contexts

Contexts are objects that contain information about:
- Workflow run (`github`)
- Job status (`needs`)
- Runner environment (`runner`)
- Step outputs (`steps`)
- And more

### 1. GitHub Context Example

```yaml
name: PR Info Check
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  check-pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Show PR Info
        run: |
          echo "PR Number: ${{ github.event.number }}"
          echo "PR Title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
          echo "Actor: ${{ github.actor }}"
          echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
          echo "Event Name: ${{ github.event_name }}"
          echo "SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"
```

### 2. Job Status Context (`needs`)

```yaml
name: Dependent Jobs
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      build_id: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.build_id }}
    steps:
      - id: set-output
        run: echo "build_id=$(date +%s)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Using build ID ${{ needs.build.outputs.build_id }}"

  deploy:
    needs: [build, test]
    if: ${{ needs.build.result == 'success' && needs.test.result == 'success' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying build ${{ needs.build.outputs.build_id }}"
```

Great question! 👇

---

### ✅ Why Use `needs.build.outputs.build_id`?

When you reference a variable like this:

```yaml
${{ needs.build.outputs.build_id }}
```

You are:

1. **Accessing another job’s outputs** (`build_id`).
2. Via the `needs` context, which is **the only way to access outputs from one job in another job** in GitHub Actions.

---

### ❓Is There Any Other Way?

Let’s break it down:

| Use Case                            | Way to Share Data                               | Notes                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Between steps in the same job** | `${{ steps.step_id.outputs.var }}`              | Direct access to step output. No `needs` required.                    |
| ✅ **Between jobs**                  | `${{ needs.job_id.outputs.var }}`               | **`needs` is required.** This is the official and only supported way. |
| ✅ **Across jobs using artifacts**   | `actions/upload-artifact` & `download-artifact` | Used to pass files or large data between jobs.                        |
| ✅ **Via environment variables**     | `echo "VAR=value" >> $GITHUB_ENV`               | Only within the same job. Doesn’t persist across jobs.                |
| ✅ **Reusable workflows**            | Pass outputs via `outputs:` block               | Used when calling workflows as actions.                               |

---

### 🧪 Can You Use `env:` or `steps.outputs` in Other Jobs?

No. These are **scoped only to the job** or steps within the job. For example:

```yaml
env:
  MY_VAR: something
```

or

```yaml
steps.step_id.outputs.some_output
```

will **not be accessible** outside the job.

---

### ✅ Final Answer

**To pass data from one job to another, `needs.<job_id>.outputs.<var>` is the only official and supported way.**

Alternative methods like **artifacts** or using **reusable workflows** are for more advanced or larger use cases but are not a direct substitute for `needs`.

Excellent observation, Deepak! 👏
This touches on a subtle but **important design pattern in GitHub Actions.**

---

### 🔍 Question Recap

You're asking:
**How can we write this at the top of the job (before the steps are defined)?**

```yaml
outputs:
  build_id: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.build_id }}
```

Even though `steps.set-output.outputs.build_id` is only set *later* in the `steps` section?

---

### ✅ Here's How It Works

This is **not executed in order like a script.**
GitHub Actions **first parses the entire YAML**, builds a **job dependency graph**, and **resolves variable references at runtime** — **after the steps complete**.

> Think of the `outputs:` section as a **declaration** that says:
>
> > “After all steps run, assign this job output `build_id` the value of the step output `build_id` from step `set-output`.”

So even though it’s written *above* the step, the actual **evaluation happens after** the `steps` run.

---

### 🧠 Think of it Like This

It’s just like defining a function output using a return value from a statement that runs inside the function:

```python
def my_function():
    x = compute_something()
    return x
```

The return (`outputs:`) is written first in YAML but depends on logic that runs later (`steps`).

---

### ⚙️ Execution Flow of GitHub Actions

1. GitHub reads the entire YAML and builds the job/step graph.
2. During execution, it runs `steps` one by one.
3. After the step with `id: set-output` runs, it sets its output to `GITHUB_OUTPUT`.
4. GitHub then evaluates the `outputs:` block using that step's result.
5. The job now officially "has an output" (`build_id`) which can be used by downstream jobs via `needs.build.outputs.build_id`.

---

### ✅ Summary

* The `outputs:` block is a **declaration**, not immediately executed.
* It **waits until steps finish** and **then pulls values** from the specified step outputs.
* This is how you can reference a value from a step declared *below* the `outputs:` block.
---

Absolutely, Deepak! Here's a **debug-style visual diagram** showing **how GitHub Actions evaluates job outputs** across jobs — with emphasis on how values flow **even if referenced earlier** in the YAML:

---

### 🧠 High-Level View

```yaml
jobs:
  build:                           👈 Job declared
    outputs:                       👈 Declared output (but NOT evaluated yet!)
      build_id: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.build_id }}
    steps:
      - id: set-output             👈 Step starts
        run: echo "build_id=$(date +%s)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

---

### 🧪 Runtime Execution Flow (Debug Style)

```plaintext
[Parser] Reading workflow YAML...

➡️ JOB: build
   ↪️ Declaring output: build_id = steps.set-output.outputs.build_id
   (NOTE: This is NOT resolved now, just stored as a reference.)

➡️ Running job: build
   ✔️ Step: set-output
      ⤷ Command: echo "build_id=1720043965" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      ⤷ Output generated: build_id=1720043965

✅ All steps complete.

📌 Resolving job outputs...
   build_id = steps.set-output.outputs.build_id
   ⤷ Resolved value: 1720043965

🏁 Job build finished with output:
   build_id = 1720043965
```

---

### ⬇️ Now in the Dependent Job (`test` or `deploy`):

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    needs: build
    steps:
      - run: echo "Using build ID ${{ needs.build.outputs.build_id }}"
```

```plaintext
[Runner] Starting job: test
   ⤷ Needs output from job 'build'
   ⤷ build_id = 1720043965 (already resolved)

💬 Step output:
   "Using build ID 1720043965"
```

---

### 🔄 Visual Summary of Flow

```
           +------------------+
           |   Job: build     |
           |------------------|
           | step: set-output |
           |   --> build_id   |
           +------------------+
                   |
                   ▼
       [outputs] build_id: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.build_id }}
                   |
                   ▼
         Output available as:
         ✅ needs.build.outputs.build_id
```

---

### ✅ Final Takeaway

* `outputs:` at the top of a job is like saying:
  **"Once step `set-output` runs, grab its result and publish it for others to use."**

* Downstream jobs (`test`, `deploy`) don’t care where it’s declared — only that the `build` job **successfully completed** and **populated the output**.

## Advanced Expression Examples

### 1. Conditional Execution

```yaml
name: Conditional Workflow
on: push

jobs:
  check-changes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      docs-changed: ${{ steps.check-files.outputs.docs-changed }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - id: check-files
        run: |
          changes=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -c '^docs/')
          echo "docs-changed=$([ $changes -gt 0 ] && echo "true" || echo "false")" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  build-docs:
    needs: check-changes
    if: ${{ needs.check-changes.outputs.docs-changed == 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building documentation..."
```

### 2. Complex Conditions

```yaml
name: Smart Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: |
      ${{ 
        github.event_name == 'push' || 
        (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && 
         github.event.pull_request.merged == true)
      }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```

### 3. Matrix with Expressions

```yaml
name: Matrix Build
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
        exclude:
          - os: windows-latest
            version: 10
    steps:
      - name: Build with Node ${{ matrix.version }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
        run: |
          echo "Building for Node.js ${{ matrix.version }}"
          echo "Running on ${{ runner.os }}"
          echo "Event was triggered by ${{ github.actor }}"
```

## Context Object Reference

Here are some commonly used context properties:

### `github` context:
- `github.actor`: Who triggered the workflow
- `github.event`: The full webhook payload
- `github.event_name`: The name of the triggering event
- `github.repository`: The repository name
- `github.ref`: The branch or tag ref
- `github.sha`: The commit SHA

### `env` context:
- Access environment variables
- `${{ env.MY_VAR }}`

### `steps` context:
- Access outputs from previous steps
- `${{ steps.step-id.outputs.output-name }}`

### `runner` context:
- `runner.os`: The runner's operating system
- `runner.temp`: Temporary directory path
- `runner.tool_cache`: Tool cache directory

## Best Practices

1. **Quote expressions** when they might evaluate to empty strings
2. **Use simple conditions** for better readability
3. **Test complex expressions** thoroughly
4. **Use outputs** to pass data between jobs
5. **Prefer contexts** over environment variables when possible

## Debugging Expressions

Add a debug step to see context values:

```yaml
- name: Debug context
  run: |
    echo "Event payload: ${{ toJSON(github.event) }}"
    echo "Full github context: ${{ toJSON(github) }}"
    echo "Job context: ${{ toJSON(job) }}"

    or
      - name: Dump Contexts
        run: |
          echo '${{ toJson(github) }}'
          echo '${{ toJson(job) }}'
          echo '${{ toJson(secrets) }}'
          echo '${{ toJson(steps) }}'
          echo '${{ toJson(runner) }}'
```

```yam

name: Expressions & Contexts
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual trigger

run-name: "Expressions & Contexts by @${{ github.actor }}, event: ${{ github.event_name }}"

jobs:
  using-expressions-and-contexts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Expressions
        id: expressions
        run: |
          echo ${{ 1 }}
          echo ${{ 'This is a string' }}
          echo ${{ null }}
          echo ${{ true }}
          echo ${{ 1 > 2 }}
          echo ${{ 'string' == 'String' }}
          echo ${{ true && false }}
          echo ${{ true || (false && true) }}
      - name: Dump Contexts
        run: |
          echo '${{ toJson(github) }}'
          echo '${{ toJson(job) }}'
          echo '${{ toJson(secrets) }}'
          echo '${{ toJson(steps) }}'
          echo '${{ toJson(runner) }}'

```

Expressions and contexts provide the flexibility to create dynamic, responsive workflows that adapt to different situations and make decisions based on runtime information.

# GitHub Actions: `if`, `key`, and Expression Functions Explained with Real-World Examples

GitHub Actions provides powerful workflow automation capabilities, and understanding conditional logic (`if`), key operations, and expression functions is essential for creating efficient workflows. Let me explain these with practical, non-NPM examples.

## 1. The `if` Conditional

The `if` conditional allows you to run jobs or steps only when certain conditions are met.

### Real-World Example: Deploy Only to Production on Main Branch

```yaml
name: Deployment Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, staging ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/staging'
        run: ./deploy-script.sh --env staging
        
      - name: Deploy to Production
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: ./deploy-script.sh --env production
```

In this example:
- The staging deployment only runs when pushing to the `staging` branch
- The production deployment only runs when pushing to the `main` branch

## 2. Key Operations in Matrix Strategies

The `key` is often used in matrix strategies to create unique identifiers for combinations.

### Real-World Example: Testing Across Multiple Platforms and Python Versions

```yaml
name: Python Cross-Platform Tests
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10']
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            key: ubuntu
          - os: windows-latest
            key: windows
          - os: macos-latest
            key: macos
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
        env:
          PLATFORM_KEY: ${{ matrix.key }}-py${{ matrix.python-version }}
```

Here, the `key` provides a simplified identifier for each OS that can be used in environment variables or logs.

## 3. Expression Functions

GitHub Actions provides several expression functions for string manipulation, logical operations, and more.

### Common Expression Functions:

1. **contains()**: Check if a string contains a substring
2. **startsWith()/endsWith()**: Check string prefixes/suffixes
3. **format()**: String formatting
4. **join()**: Join array elements
5. **toJSON()/fromJSON()**: Convert between JSON and objects
6. **hashFiles()**: Generate hash for files

### Real-World Example 1: Conditional Step Based on File Changes

```yaml
name: Documentation CI
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'docs/**'
      - 'README.md'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Build PDF documentation
        if: contains(github.event.head_commit.modified_files, 'docs/')
        run: make pdf-docs
        
      - name: Build HTML documentation
        if: contains(github.event.head_commit.modified_files, 'docs/') || contains(github.event.head_commit.modified_files, 'README.md')
        run: make html-docs
        
      - name: Notify team
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: ./notify-team.sh "Documentation updated on main branch"
```

### Real-World Example 2: Dynamic Workflow with Matrix and Formatting

```yaml
name: Docker Build and Push
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        image: ['webapp', 'api', 'worker']
        include:
          - image: 'webapp'
            dockerfile: 'Dockerfile.web'
          - image: 'api'
            dockerfile: 'Dockerfile.api'
          - image: 'worker'
            dockerfile: 'Dockerfile.worker'
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          context: .
          file: ${{ matrix.dockerfile }}
          tags: |
            myorg/${{ matrix.image }}:${{ github.ref_name }}
            myorg/${{ matrix.image }}:latest
          push: ${{ github.event_name == 'release' }}
```

## Key Takeaways:

1. **`if` conditionals** are essential for controlling workflow execution based on events, branches, file changes, or other context.
2. **Key operations** in matrices help create meaningful identifiers for complex combinations.
3. **Expression functions** like `contains()`, `startsWith()`, and `format()` enable powerful string manipulation directly in your workflow files.
4. You can combine these features to create sophisticated, conditional workflows that respond intelligently to different GitHub events.

These examples demonstrate real-world scenarios like conditional deployments, matrix testing, documentation builds, Docker image management, and security scanning - all without relying on NPM-specific examples.
