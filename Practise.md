| #  | Task                                                                                   | Hint                                         |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Create a workflow that runs on every push to `main` and prints "Hello GitHub Actions". | Use `on: push` with `branches`.              |
| 2  | Set up a workflow to trigger manually from the Actions tab.                            | Use `workflow_dispatch`.                     |
| 3  | Create a job that runs on `ubuntu-latest` and lists all files in the repo.             | Use `ls -la`.                                |
| 4  | Set an environment variable `GREETING=Hi` and print it.                                | Use `env:` at the step or job level.         |
| 5  | Checkout code and run `npm install` (assume package.json exists).                      | Use `actions/checkout` and `run:`.           |
| 6  | Add a second job called `test` that depends on a `build` job.                          | Use `needs:`.                                |
| 7  | Run a job only when the actor is not `dependabot`.                                     | Use `if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'`. |
| 8  | Use a matrix build to test on Node.js versions 14 and 16.                              | Use `strategy.matrix.node-version`.          |
| 9  | Cache `node_modules` using `actions/cache`.                                            | Use correct `key` and `path`.                |

| 14 | Reference a secret called `MY_SECRET` in your workflow.                                | Use `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`.              |
| 15 | Fail a step intentionally and mark it to not fail the workflow.                        | Use `continue-on-error: true`.               |
| 16 | Create a reusable workflow with an input called `name`.                                | Use `workflow_call` and `inputs`.            |

| 18 | Set a job output `message` as "done" and use it in another job.                        | Use `outputs:` and `needs`.                  |
| 19 | Create a badge for your workflow in the `README.md`.                                   | Use Actions badge markdown syntax.           |
| 20 | Schedule your workflow to run every day at 3am UTC.                                    | Use `on: schedule` with cron syntax.         |

| 15 | Run tests in parallel using matrix and collect results.                   | Use matrix + artifact upload.                    |
| 16 | Retry a failed step up to 3 times.                                        | Use `retry` pattern via script or action.        |
| 17 | Use `.env` file and load variables into the job.                          | `dotenv` parser or `source` it in a `bash` step. |
| 18 | Use `strategy.fail-fast: false` to continue matrix jobs.                  | Helpful in test suites.                          |
| 19 | Trigger workflow only on push to `src/**.js` files.                       | Use `on.push.paths`.                             |
| 20 | Use GitHub Actions to deploy a Node app to Heroku.                        | Use Heroku CLI and API key in secrets.           |

## üî• Advanced Workflow Challenges (20 Problems)

| #  | Task                                                                             | Hint                                                               |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | Setup and register a self-hosted runner on Ubuntu.                               | Use `./config.sh` and `./run.sh`.                                  |
| 2  | Create a self-hosted runner group and restrict workflows to it.                  | Use `runs-on: [self-hosted, <label>]`.                             |
| 3  | Use OIDC with AWS to assume IAM role from GitHub Actions.                        | Use `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` with `role-to-assume`. |
| 4  | Trigger a workflow in another repo using the REST API.                           | Use `actions/github-script`.                                       |
| 5  | Build a Docker-based GitHub Action and publish it to Marketplace.                | Requires `Dockerfile` and `action.yml`.                            |
| 6  | Create a JavaScript GitHub Action with Octokit to list issues.                   | Use `@actions/core`, `@actions/github`.                            |
| 7  | Implement approval gates using `environments` and protected reviewers.           | Repo settings required.                                            |
| 8  | Use `fromJSON()` to dynamically build a matrix strategy.                         | Useful for dynamic values.                                         |
| 9  | Create a reusable workflow that triggers only from `dev-*` branches.             | Combine `workflow_call` and `on.push.branches`.                    |
| 10 | Poll the status of another repo‚Äôs workflow until completion.                     | Use GitHub REST API.                                               |
| 11 | Store Terraform plan output as artifact and use in apply job.                    | Use `upload-artifact`.                                             |
| 12 | Create a pipeline to scan Docker images with Trivy and block on vulnerabilities. | Trivy GitHub Action.                                               |
| 13 | Deploy to Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl` from GitHub Actions.                | Requires kubeconfig in secrets.                                    |
| 14 | Build and push a Helm chart to OCI registry using GitHub Actions.                | Use `helm` CLI in the runner.                                      |
| 15 | Use secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager using GitHub Actions.                  | Pull via `aws secretsmanager`.                                     |
| 16 | Implement canary deployments with GitHub Actions and feature flags.              | Split traffic using deployment scripts.                            |
| 17 | Run performance tests after deployment and send report.                          | Use Apache Benchmark or k6.                                        |
| 18 | Set up a workflow to trigger on a tag that matches `v*.*.*`.                     | Use `on.push.tags`.                                                |
| 19 | Create a GitHub Action that lints YAML and JSON files only on PRs.               | Combine filters and reusable action.                               |
| 20 | Use concurrency + cancellation to cancel stale deployments.                      | Use `concurrency: deploy-${{ github.ref }}`.                       |
