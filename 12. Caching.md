# Caching Files in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides a caching mechanism to store files and directories that your workflows frequently use, reducing execution time by avoiding redundant downloads or rebuilds.

## How Caching Works in GitHub Actions

The `actions/cache` action allows you to save files between workflow runs. When you create a cache, it's stored by a key you specify. On subsequent runs, the workflow can restore the cache using the same key.

## Basic Example (Python)

```yaml
name: Python CI with cache

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    
    - name: Cache pip packages
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Java Example (Gradle)

```yaml
name: Java CI with cache

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Cache Gradle packages
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: |
          ~/.gradle/caches
          ~/.gradle/wrapper
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-
    
    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: ./gradlew build
```

## Rust Example (Cargo)

```yaml
name: Rust CI with cache

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Cache cargo registry
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: |
          ~/.cargo/registry
          ~/.cargo/git
          target
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
    
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --verbose
```

## Key Parameters

- `path`: The file paths to cache (can be a single path or multiple paths)
- `key`: Unique identifier for the cache
- `restore-keys`: Ordered list of keys to use for restoring stale cache if exact match not found

## Cache Limits

- GitHub removes any cache entries that haven't been accessed in over 7 days
- The total size of all caches in a repository is limited (10 GB for GitHub Free, 20 GB for GitHub Pro, 50 GB for GitHub Team/Enterprise)

# GitHub Actions Cache Limits and Restrictions

GitHub Actions provides caching capabilities to speed up workflows, but there are important limits and restrictions you should be aware of:

## Storage Limits

| Account Type       | Total Cache Storage Limit |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| GitHub Free        | 10 GB                    |
| GitHub Pro         | 20 GB                    |
| GitHub Team        | 50 GB                    |
| GitHub Enterprise  | 50 GB                    |

## Cache Eviction Policy

- **Automatic eviction**: Caches are automatically deleted after **7 days of no access**
- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: When approaching storage limits, GitHub will evict the least recently accessed caches first

## Other Important Restrictions

1. **Cache Size Limits**:
   - No individual cache can exceed **10 GB**
   - If a cache exceeds the limit, the action will fail

2. **Cache Scope**:
   - Caches are scoped to the repository where they were created
   - Caches cannot be shared across repositories (except via artifact downloads)

3. **Rate Limits**:
   - You can save up to **1000 caches per repository**
   - There's a limit on cache operations per minute (exact number not documented)

4. **Branch Restrictions**:
   - Caches created in a branch are accessible to workflows in that branch and its base branch
   - Caches are not automatically shared across forks

5. **Cache Key Restrictions**:
   - Keys must be less than **512 characters** in length
   - Keys can only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores

## Best Practices to Work Within Limits

1. **Be selective** about what you cache (only dependencies, not build outputs)
2. **Use precise keys** (like hash-based keys) to avoid cache duplication
3. **Set expiration** for caches you know will become obsolete
4. **Clean up old caches** manually if you're approaching limits
5. **Split large caches** into multiple smaller ones if needed

## Checking Cache Usage

You can view your cache usage:
1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Actions"
3. Select the "Caches" tab

## Best Practices

1. Use specific keys that change when your dependencies change (like hashing lock files)
2. Include the OS in your key for cross-platform compatibility
3. Use `restore-keys` for partial cache hits
4. Avoid caching large files that don't significantly improve build time
