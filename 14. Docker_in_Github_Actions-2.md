### ✅ Using Docker Containers **in Steps** (Not as Job-level Containers)

Sometimes you don’t want the **entire job** to run in a Docker container — instead, you want to **run specific steps** in their own container. This is useful for:

* Running isolated tools (e.g., Terraform, Trivy, Kubectl).
* Avoiding environment pollution.
* Avoiding custom runners.

---

### 🔹 Method: `uses: docker://<image>` in a step

GitHub Actions allows you to run a **step inside a Docker container** directly using this syntax:

```yaml
- name: Run in container
  uses: docker://<image-name>
```

---

### ✅ Example: Run a Step Using Alpine Container

```yaml
name: Step with Docker Container

on: [push]

jobs:
  docker-step:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Hello from Alpine
        uses: docker://alpine:latest
        with:
          args: echo "Hello from inside a Docker container!"
```

> 🔸 `args:` provides the command to run inside the container.

---

### ✅ Example: Use Trivy Container to Scan for Vulnerabilities

```yaml
name: Trivy Security Scan

on: [push]

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Trivy scan
        uses: docker://aquasec/trivy:latest
        with:
          args: fs --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .
```

> This will run `trivy` inside its own official container, scanning your codebase in the GitHub workspace.

---

### ✅ Example: Use Custom Docker Image with Environment Variables

```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run in Node Container
        uses: docker://node:20
        env:
          ENV_VAR: production
        with:
          args: node -e "console.log(process.env.ENV_VAR)"
```

---

### ⚠ Notes:

* This **does not support multiple commands** or `run:` blocks like native steps.
* It does **not mount your workspace** by default, so you can’t access files unless you:

  * Mount them manually in your Dockerfile
  * Or use full job containers instead (via `container:`)

In GitHub Actions (or Docker in general), **shared networks and volumes between multiple containers** are important for enabling **inter-container communication** and **data persistence or sharing**.

---

## ✅ Context

In GitHub Actions, you can:

* Use **services**: temporary containers like databases, caches, etc.
* Use **volumes**: shared storage between containers or between host and containers.
* Use **Docker Compose**: to run multiple containers with shared volumes and networks.

---

## 🔹 1. **Shared Network Using `services:` in GitHub Actions**

GitHub automatically **creates a Docker network** and attaches the main container and all services to it.

### ✅ Example: App Container Talks to MySQL Service

```yaml
name: Shared Network Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: node:18
    services:
      mysql:
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
          MYSQL_DATABASE: testdb
        ports:
          - 3306:3306
        options: >-
          --health-cmd="mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1 -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"
          --health-interval=10s
          --health-timeout=5s
          --health-retries=3
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install mysql client
        run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client

      - name: Connect to MySQL
        run: mysql -h mysql -u root -ppassword -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```

> 🔸 `mysql` here is the hostname — resolved via the shared Docker network GitHub Actions sets up.

---

## 🔹 2. **Shared Volume Between Containers (Using Docker Compose)**

GitHub Actions doesn't directly support volumes between services or across jobs, but you can use **`docker-compose`** to create your own network and volume setup.

### ✅ Example: Shared Volume Between `app` and `logger`

📁 `.github/workflows/docker-compose-volume.yml`

```yaml
name: Shared Volume with Compose

on: [push]

jobs:
  compose:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Docker Compose
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
          sleep 10
          docker-compose logs

      - name: Teardown
        run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

📁 `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    image: busybox
    volumes:
      - shared-data:/data
    command: sh -c "echo Hello > /data/message.txt && sleep 20"

  logger:
    image: busybox
    volumes:
      - shared-data:/data
    command: sh -c "sleep 5 && cat /data/message.txt && sleep 10"

volumes:
  shared-data:
```

🟢 `logger` reads the file created by `app` because both use the `shared-data` volume.

---

## 🔹 3. **Manual Docker Run with Shared Volume**

If not using Docker Compose, use manual `docker run` with `--volumes-from` or `-v`.

```bash
docker run -d --name data-writer -v shared-vol:/app busybox sh -c "echo hi > /app/data.txt && sleep 60"
docker run --rm --volumes-from data-writer busybox cat /app/data.txt
```
