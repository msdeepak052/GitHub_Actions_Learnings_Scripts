# **GitHub Actions - The Complete Guide**

### **1. What is GitHub Actions?**
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform that automates workflows triggered by GitHub events (e.g., push, pull request, issue creation).

#### **Key Terms:**
- **Workflow**: A YAML file (`.yml`) defining automation steps.
- **Event**: Triggers a workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
- **Job**: A set of steps that run on the same runner (VM).
- **Step**: Individual task (can run a script or action).
- **Action**: Reusable unit of code (e.g., checkout, install dependencies).

### **My First Workflow***
```yaml
name: First Workflow
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-shell-command:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run shell command
        run: echo "Hello, World!"
      
      - name: List files in current directory
        run: ls -la

---
### **2. Basic Workflow Example**
Create a file at `.github/workflows/main.yml`:
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push]  # Trigger on push event

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Runner OS
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Official action to fetch code

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install  # Runs a shell command

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

#### **Explanation:**
- `on: [push]`: Workflow runs on every `git push`.
- `jobs`: Contains one job named `build`.
- `runs-on`: Specifies the VM environment.
- `steps`: Sequential tasks (checkout â†’ install â†’ test).

---

### **3. Key Concepts with Examples**

#### **a) Events**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Only on pushes to main
  pull_request:
    branches: [ feature/* ]  # Only PRs to feature branches
```

#### **b) Environment Variables & Secrets**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy
    env:
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}  # Secret stored in GitHub Settings
    run: echo "Deploying with API key..."
```

#### **c) Matrix Strategy (Parallel Jobs)**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]  # Test across Node.js versions
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
```

#### **d) Caching Dependencies**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: node_modules
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
```

---

### **4. Real-World Use Cases**
#### **a) Auto-Deploy to GitHub Pages**
```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm install && npm run build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

#### **b) Notify Slack on Failure**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Notify Slack
    if: failure()  # Only on job failure
    uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
    with:
      slack-message: "Build failed!"
    env:
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

---

### **5. Important Commands & Tips**
- **Manual Trigger**: Use `workflow_dispatch`:
  ```yaml
  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
      inputs:
        environment:
          description: 'Env to deploy'
          required: true
  ```
- **View Logs**: Go to `Actions` tab in your GitHub repo.
- **Debugging**: Add `run: env` to print all environment variables.

---

### **6. Advanced: Reusable Workflows**
Create a shared workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/shared.yml`):
```yaml
name: Shared CI
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
```

Call it from another workflow:
```yaml
uses: ./.github/workflows/shared.yml
with:
  node-version: '18.x'
```

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Try automating a test suite for your project.
2. Explore the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) for pre-built actions.
3. Learn about `needs` for job dependencies.

### **Manual Trigger in GitHub Actions (`workflow_dispatch`)**
To manually trigger a workflow (without relying on `push` or `pull_request`), use the `workflow_dispatch` event. This adds a **"Run workflow"** button in the GitHub UI.

---

### **Example: Basic Manual Trigger**
```yaml
name: Manual Trigger Demo
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual trigger

jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Greet
        run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions! ðŸŽ‰"
```

#### **How to Run:**
1. Push this workflow to your repo.
2. Go to **Actions** tab â†’ Select the workflow â†’ Click **"Run workflow"**.

---

### **Advanced: Manual Trigger with Inputs**
You can pass inputs (e.g., environment, version) when triggering manually:

```yaml
name: Deploy with Inputs
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deploy environment'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production
      version:
        description: 'App version'
        required: false
        type: string

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print inputs
        run: |
          echo "Environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}"
          echo "Version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version || 'latest' }}"
```

#### **How to Run:**
1. In the GitHub UI, youâ€™ll see a form to fill in inputs:  
   ![Manual Trigger Inputs](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/manual-trigger-workflow.png)
2. Click **"Run workflow"** after filling the fields.

---

### **Key Notes:**
1. **`workflow_dispatch` vs `repository_dispatch`**:
   - `workflow_dispatch`: Trigger from GitHub UI or API.
   - `repository_dispatch`: Trigger via API only (useful for external events).

2. **GitHub CLI Alternative**:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=production -f version=1.0
   ```

3. **Default Values**: Use `default` for optional inputs.

---

### **Real-World Use Case**
```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      env:
        description: 'AWS environment'
        options: [dev, prod]
      confirm:
        description: 'Type "yes" to deploy'
        required: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    if: github.event.inputs.confirm == 'yes'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to ${{ github.event.inputs.env }}..."
```

This ensures manual confirmation before deployment.

# **Parallel and Dependent Jobs in GitHub Actions**

GitHub Actions allows you to run jobs **in parallel** for faster execution or **sequentially** (dependent jobs) where one job waits for another to complete. Below is a detailed breakdown with examples.

---

## **1. Parallel Jobs**
Jobs run in parallel by default (unless dependencies are specified). This is useful for tasks like **testing across multiple OSes or Node.js versions**.

### **Example: Parallel Jobs**
```yaml
name: Parallel Jobs Example
on: [push]

jobs:
  test-linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running tests on Linux"

  test-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running tests on Windows"

  test-macos:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running tests on macOS"
```
**Key Points:**
- All 3 jobs (`test-linux`, `test-windows`, `test-macos`) run **simultaneously**.
- No dependency means they execute independently.

---

## **2. Dependent Jobs (Sequential Execution)**
Use `needs` to define job dependencies. A job will only run if its dependent jobs succeed.

### **Example: Sequential Jobs**
```yaml
name: Dependent Jobs Example
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual trigger

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build the application
        run: echo "Building the app..."
      - name: Wait for 30 seconds
        run: sleep 30s  # Linux/macOS (use 'Start-Sleep -Seconds 30' for Windows)

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build  # Waits for 'build' to finish
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: echo "Running tests..."
      - name: Wait for 30 seconds
        run: sleep 30s  # Linux/macOS (use 'Start-Sleep -Seconds 30' for Windows)


  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test   # Waits for 'test' to finish
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: echo "Deploying to production..."
      - name: Wait for 30 seconds
        run: sleep 30s  # Linux/macOS (use 'Start-Sleep -Seconds 30' for Windows)

```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d21bb024-b9a3-4c1b-aee4-8fd6fee5322e)

**Key Points:**
- `deploy` runs **only after** `test` succeeds.
- `test` runs **only after** `build` succeeds.
- If `build` fails, `test` and `deploy` are **skipped**.

---

## **3. Mixed Parallel & Dependent Jobs**
You can combine both approaches for complex workflows.

### **Example: Parallel Tests â†’ Sequential Deployment**
```yaml
name: Mixed Parallel and Sequential
on: [push]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running linter..."

  test-unit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running unit tests..."

  test-integration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running integration tests..."

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, test-unit, test-integration]  # Waits for all 3 jobs
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying after all checks pass..."
```
**Key Points:**
- `lint`, `test-unit`, and `test-integration` run **in parallel**.
- `deploy` runs **only after all 3 jobs complete successfully**.

---

## **4. Job Status Conditions**
Control job execution based on previous job status using `if`.

### **Example: Conditional Deployment**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building..."

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - run: echo "Testing..."

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    if: success()  # Only runs if 'test' succeeds
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying..."
```

**Key Conditions:**
- `if: success()` â†’ Runs if previous job succeeds.
- `if: failure()` â†’ Runs if previous job fails (useful for notifications).
- `if: always()` â†’ Runs regardless of previous job status.

---

## **5. Matrix Strategy (Parallel Jobs with Variations)**
Run the same job in parallel with different configurations (e.g., OS, Node.js versions).

### **Example: Testing Across Multiple Node.js Versions**
```yaml
name: Matrix Example
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]  # Runs 3 parallel jobs
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm test
```
**Key Points:**
- Creates **3 parallel jobs** for each `node-version`.
- Useful for **cross-version compatibility testing**.

---

## **6. Important Notes**
1. **Job Dependencies**:
   - Use `needs` to define order.
   - Jobs without `needs` run in parallel.
2. **Max Parallel Jobs**:
   - GitHub Free Tier: **20 concurrent jobs**.
   - GitHub Pro/Team: **40 concurrent jobs**.
3. **Job Status**:
   - `success()`, `failure()`, `always()` control execution flow.
4. **Matrix Jobs**:
   - Great for testing multiple environments in parallel.

---

## **Real-World Use Cases**
### **1. CI/CD Pipeline with Parallel Tests**
```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run lint

  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: [lint, test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run deploy
```
- `lint` and `test` run in parallel.
- `deploy` waits for both to complete.

### **2. Conditional Deployment on Main Branch**
```yaml
deploy:
  needs: test
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && success()
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```
- Only deploys if:
  - Branch is `main`.
  - `test` job succeeds.

---

## **Final Summary**
| Concept | Syntax | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Parallel Jobs** | No `needs` | Run independent tasks simultaneously |
| **Dependent Jobs** | `needs: [job1, job2]` | Run jobs in sequence |
| **Matrix Strategy** | `strategy.matrix` | Test across multiple environments |
| **Conditional Jobs** | `if: success()` | Control execution based on status |
