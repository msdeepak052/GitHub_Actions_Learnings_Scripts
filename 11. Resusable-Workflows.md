# Reusable Workflows in GitHub Actions

Reusable workflows allow you to define a workflow in one repository that can be referenced and executed by other workflows, either in the same repository or across different repositories. This promotes code reuse, reduces duplication, and makes maintenance easier.

## Key Features

1. **Call workflows from other workflows**
2. **Share workflows across repositories**
3. **Pass inputs and secrets to called workflows**
4. **Receive outputs from called workflows**

## Basic Syntax

```yaml
jobs:
  call-reusable-workflow:
    uses: OWNER/REPO/.github/workflows/WORKFLOW_FILE.yml@BRANCH
    with:
      input1: value1
      input2: value2
    secrets:
      secret1: ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Reusable Workflow

**Reusable workflow (in .github/workflows/shared.yml):**
```yaml
name: Shared CI Pipeline

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string
      environment:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: 'staging'

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ inputs.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
          
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
      
      - name: Show environment
        run: echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
```

**Calling workflow:**
```yaml
name: Main CI Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  call-shared-workflow:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/shared.yml
    with:
      node-version: '18.x'
      environment: 'production'
```

### Example 2: Cross-Repository Reusable Workflow

**Reusable workflow (in org/shared-repo):**
```yaml
name: Shared Deployment

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      target-env:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      api-token:
        required: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.target-env }}
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.target-env }}"
          echo "Using API token ${{ secrets.api-token }}"
```

**Calling workflow (in another repo):**
```yaml
name: Product Deployment

on: [push]

jobs:
  call-shared-deployment:
    uses: my-org/shared-repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
    with:
      target-env: 'production'
    secrets:
      api-token: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_TOKEN }}
```

### Example 3: Reusable Workflow with Outputs

**Reusable workflow:**
```yaml
name: Generate Build Info

on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      build-id:
        description: "The generated build ID"
        value: ${{ jobs.generate.outputs.build-id }}

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      build-id: ${{ steps.generate-id.outputs.build-id }}
    steps:
      - id: generate-id
        run: echo "::set-output name=build-id::$(date +%s)"
```

**Calling workflow:**
```yaml
name: Main Build Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  get-build-id:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/generate-build-info.yml
  
  use-build-id:
    needs: get-build-id
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "The build ID is ${{ needs.get-build-id.outputs.build-id }}"
```

Reusable workflows are particularly useful for:
- Standardizing CI/CD pipelines across multiple repositories
- Sharing common build/test/deploy patterns
- Reducing maintenance overhead for similar workflows
- Enforcing consistent practices across an organization
