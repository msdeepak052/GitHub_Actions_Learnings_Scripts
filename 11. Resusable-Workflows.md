# Reusable Workflows in GitHub Actions

Reusable workflows allow you to define a workflow in one repository that can be referenced and executed by other workflows, either in the same repository or across different repositories. This promotes code reuse, reduces duplication, and makes maintenance easier.

## Key Features

1. **Call workflows from other workflows**
2. **Share workflows across repositories**
3. **Pass inputs and secrets to called workflows**
4. **Receive outputs from called workflows**

## Basic Syntax

```yaml
jobs:
  call-reusable-workflow:
    uses: OWNER/REPO/.github/workflows/WORKFLOW_FILE.yml@BRANCH
    with:
      input1: value1
      input2: value2
    secrets:
      secret1: ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Reusable Workflow

**Reusable workflow (in .github/workflows/shared.yml):**
```yaml
name: Shared CI Pipeline

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string
      environment:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: 'staging'

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ inputs.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
          
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
      
      - name: Show environment
        run: echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
```

**Calling workflow:**
```yaml
name: Main CI Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  call-shared-workflow:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/shared.yml
    with:
      node-version: '18.x'
      environment: 'production'
```

### Example 2: Cross-Repository Reusable Workflow

**Reusable workflow (in org/shared-repo):**
```yaml
name: Shared Deployment

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      target-env:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      api-token:
        required: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.target-env }}
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.target-env }}"
          echo "Using API token ${{ secrets.api-token }}"
```

**Calling workflow (in another repo):**
```yaml
name: Product Deployment

on: [push]

jobs:
  call-shared-deployment:
    uses: my-org/shared-repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
    with:
      target-env: 'production'
    secrets:
      api-token: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_TOKEN }}
```

### Example 3: Reusable Workflow with Outputs

**Reusable workflow:**
```yaml
name: Generate Build Info

on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      build-id:
        description: "The generated build ID"
        value: ${{ jobs.generate.outputs.build-id }}

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      build-id: ${{ steps.generate-id.outputs.build-id }}
    steps:
      - id: generate-id
        run: echo "::set-output name=build-id::$(date +%s)"
```

**Calling workflow:**
```yaml
name: Main Build Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  get-build-id:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/generate-build-info.yml
  
  use-build-id:
    needs: get-build-id
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "The build ID is ${{ needs.get-build-id.outputs.build-id }}"
```

GitHub Actions **does support a similar concept to Jenkins Shared Libraries** via **[Reusable Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)** and **[Composite Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)**.

Letâ€™s break this down:

---

## âœ… 1. **Reusable Workflows** (like Jenkins Shared Pipelines)

### ðŸ“Œ What is it?

A **reusable workflow** is a full `.yml` workflow that can be **called from other workflows** â€” just like calling a shared pipeline.

### ðŸ“¦ Example Structure:

```
.github/
  workflows/
    deploy.yml          <-- Calls reusable workflow
  reusable/
    deploy-template.yml <-- Reusable workflow
```

---

### ðŸ”§ `deploy-template.yml` (Reusable Workflow)

```yaml
# .github/reusable/deploy-template.yml
name: Deploy Template

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
```

---

### ðŸ”§ `deploy.yml` (Calling Workflow)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Call Reusable Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  call-deploy:
    uses: ./.github/reusable/deploy-template.yml
    with:
      environment: production
```

## âœ… 2. **Composite Actions** (like Jenkins Shared Steps or Stages)

### ðŸ“Œ What is it?

A **composite action** is a custom action made from multiple steps. These can be reused in many workflows â€” like **shared stage definitions**.

### ðŸ“¦ Folder Structure:

```
.github/
  actions/
    say-hello/
      action.yml
```

---

### ðŸ”§ `action.yml` (Composite Action)

```yaml
# .github/actions/say-hello/action.yml
name: Say Hello
description: Reusable greeting action
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: echo "Hello, ${{ inputs.name }}!"
inputs:
  name:
    required: true
```

---

### ðŸ”§ Using Composite Action

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: Use Composite Action

on: [push]

jobs:
  greet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: ./.github/actions/say-hello
        with:
          name: Deepak
```

# Reusable Workflow Outputs in GitHub Actions

Reusable workflows in GitHub Actions allow you to define outputs that can be consumed by the calling workflow. This is useful for passing data between workflows, such as build results, test outcomes, or generated artifacts.

## How Reusable Workflow Outputs Work

1. **Defining outputs** in the reusable workflow
2. **Setting outputs** during execution
3. **Consuming outputs** in the calling workflow

## Example Implementation

### 1. Reusable Workflow (`.github/workflows/reusable.yml`)

```yaml
name: Reusable Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      build-result:
        description: "Result of the build process"
        value: ${{ jobs.build.outputs.build-result }}
      test-coverage:
        description: "Test coverage percentage"
        value: ${{ jobs.test.outputs.coverage }}

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      build-result: ${{ steps.set-build-output.outputs.result }}
    steps:
      - name: Build step
        id: set-build-output
        run: |
          # Your build logic here
          echo "result=success" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      coverage: ${{ steps.set-coverage-output.outputs.percentage }}
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        id: set-coverage-output
        run: |
          # Your test logic here
          echo "percentage=95%" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### 2. Calling Workflow (`.github/workflows/caller.yml`)

```yaml
name: Caller Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  call-reusable:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml
    
  use-outputs:
    needs: call-reusable
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Display outputs
        run: |
          echo "Build result: ${{ needs.call-reusable.outputs.build-result }}"
          echo "Test coverage: ${{ needs.call-reusable.outputs.test-coverage }}"
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb05433e-9a9e-4ae3-9e04-ff9ca9c16837)

## Key Concepts

1. **Workflow Outputs Declaration**:
   - Defined under `workflow_call.outputs`
   - Each output must specify a `description` and `value`

2. **Job Outputs**:
   - Individual jobs can define outputs
   - Outputs are set using `echo "name=value" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`

3. **Accessing Outputs**:
   - Use `needs.<job-id>.outputs.<output-name>` syntax
   - Outputs are available after the reusable workflow completes

## Advanced Example with Secrets and Inputs

```yaml
# Reusable workflow
name: Advanced Reusable

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      api-token:
        required: true
    outputs:
      deployment-url:
        description: "URL of the deployed application"
        value: ${{ jobs.deploy.outputs.url }}

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      url: ${{ steps.deploy-step.outputs.deployment-url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.environment }}
        id: deploy-step
        run: |
          # Deployment logic using ${{ secrets.api-token }}
          echo "url=https://${{ inputs.environment }}.example.com" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

```yaml
# Calling workflow
name: Call Advanced Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy-production:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/advanced-reusable.yml
    with:
      environment: production
    secrets:
      api-token: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_TOKEN }}
      
  notify:
    needs: deploy-production
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Send notification
        run: |
          echo "Deployed to ${{ needs.deploy-production.outputs.deployment-url }}"
          # Send notification logic here
```

## Official Documentation

For complete reference, see GitHub's official documentation:
- [Reusing workflows - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
- [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions - Outputs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#outputs)

## Best Practices

1. **Document your outputs** clearly in the reusable workflow
2. **Use descriptive names** for outputs
3. **Validate outputs** in the calling workflow
4. **Handle missing outputs** gracefully
5. **Keep outputs minimal** - only pass essential data

Outputs are a powerful way to create modular, reusable workflows that can communicate results back to the calling workflow.

# Nesting Reusable Workflows in GitHub Actions

Nesting reusable workflows allows you to call one reusable workflow from another, creating a hierarchy of workflow executions. This enables you to build modular, maintainable automation pipelines where complex processes are broken down into smaller, reusable components.

## How Nesting Works

1. **Top-level workflow** calls a reusable workflow
2. **Reusable workflow** can call another reusable workflow
3. **Maximum depth**: GitHub allows up to 4 levels of nesting

## Example Implementation

### 1. Base Reusable Workflow (`.github/workflows/base.yml`)

```yaml
name: Base Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      base-input:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: "default-value"
    outputs:
      base-output:
        description: "Output from base workflow"
        value: ${{ jobs.base-job.outputs.result }}

jobs:
  base-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      result: ${{ steps.set-output.outputs.value }}
    steps:
      - name: Set output
        id: set-output
        run: |
          echo "value=processed-${{ inputs.base-input }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### 2. Intermediate Reusable Workflow (`.github/workflows/intermediate.yml`)

```yaml
name: Intermediate Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      intermediate-input:
        required: true
        type: string
    outputs:
      intermediate-output:
        description: "Output from intermediate workflow"
        value: ${{ jobs.intermediate-job.outputs.combined-result }}

jobs:
  intermediate-job:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/base.yml
    with:
      base-input: ${{ inputs.intermediate-input }}-modified
    secrets: inherit

  process-results:
    needs: intermediate-job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      combined-result: ${{ steps.combine.outputs.final }}
    steps:
      - name: Combine results
        id: combine
        run: |
          echo "final=enriched-${{ needs.intermediate-job.outputs.base-output }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### 3. Top-Level Workflow (`.github/workflows/top-level.yml`)

```yaml
name: Top Level Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  call-nested:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/intermediate.yml
    with:
      intermediate-input: "initial-value"
      
  use-results:
    needs: call-nested
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Display final output
        run: |
          echo "Final result: ${{ needs.call-nested.outputs.intermediate-output }}"
          # Expected output: "Final result: enriched-processed-initial-value-modified"
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Inheritance**:
   - Child workflows inherit secrets when `secrets: inherit` is specified
   - Inputs must be explicitly passed down

2. **Output Propagation**:
   - Outputs bubble up through the chain
   - Each level can modify or enrich the outputs

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Jobs in nested workflows maintain their dependency chain
   - The calling workflow only sees the final outputs

## Advanced Example with Multiple Levels

```yaml
# Level 3 Workflow (.github/workflows/level3.yml)
name: Level 3

on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      l3-output:
        value: ${{ jobs.l3-job.outputs.data }}

jobs:
  l3-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      data: ${{ steps.gen.outputs.value }}
    steps:
      - id: gen
        run: echo "value=l3-${{ github.run_id }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

```yaml
# Level 2 Workflow (.github/workflows/level2.yml)
name: Level 2

on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      l2-output:
        value: ${{ jobs.l2-job.outputs.combined }}

jobs:
  l2-job:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/level3.yml
    secrets: inherit

  process:
    needs: l2-job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      combined: ${{ steps.combine.outputs.result }}
    steps:
      - id: combine
        run: echo "result=l2-${{ needs.l2-job.outputs.l3-output }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

```yaml
# Level 1 Workflow (.github/workflows/level1.yml)
name: Level 1

on:
  workflow_call:
    outputs:
      final-output:
        value: ${{ jobs.l1-job.outputs.result }}

jobs:
  l1-job:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/level2.yml
    secrets: inherit

  finalize:
    needs: l1-job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      result: ${{ steps.final.outputs.value }}
    steps:
      - id: final
        run: echo "value=final-${{ needs.l1-job.outputs.l2-output }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

```yaml
# Root Workflow (.github/workflows/root.yml)
name: Root Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  execute-chain:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/level1.yml
      
  show-result:
    needs: execute-chain
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Result: ${{ needs.execute-chain.outputs.final-output }}"
        # Output: "Result: final-l2-l3-{run_id}"
```

## Official Documentation

For complete reference, see GitHub's official documentation:
- [Reusing workflows - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
- [Nesting reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#nesting-reusable-workflows)

## Best Practices

1. **Limit nesting depth** (max 4 levels)
2. **Document the workflow chain** clearly
3. **Use descriptive names** for inputs/outputs at each level
4. **Consider error handling** at each level
5. **Monitor performance** as nesting adds overhead
6. **Test each level independently** before combining

Nested reusable workflows are powerful for creating complex automation pipelines while maintaining modularity and reusability of components.
