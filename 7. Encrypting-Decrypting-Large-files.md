# Encrypting and Decrypting Large Files in GitHub Actions

Here's a comprehensive guide to handling large file encryption/decryption in GitHub Actions workflows, based on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts).

## Key Concepts for Large Files

1. **Why Encrypt Large Files**:
   - Protect sensitive data in repositories
   - Securely transfer files between jobs/workflows
   - Comply with security requirements

2. **Recommended Tools**:
   - `gpg` for encryption/decryption
   - `openssl` for alternative encryption
   - GitHub Actions artifacts for storage

## Real-World Example: Secure Database Backup Processing

```yaml
name: Secure Backup Processing
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM

env:
  ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY }}
  BACKUP_FILE: 'production-db-backup.sql'
  COMPRESSED_FILE: 'backup.tar.gz'
  ENCRYPTED_FILE: 'backup.tar.gz.gpg'

jobs:
  create-backup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install PostgreSQL client
        run: sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-client

      - name: Create database dump
        run: |
          pg_dump \
            -h ${{ secrets.DB_HOST }} \
            -U ${{ secrets.DB_USER }} \
            -d ${{ secrets.DB_NAME }} \
            > $BACKUP_FILE

      - name: Compress backup
        run: tar -czvf $COMPRESSED_FILE $BACKUP_FILE

      - name: Encrypt backup
        run: |
          gpg --symmetric \
              --batch \
              --passphrase "$ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE" \
              --output $ENCRYPTED_FILE \
              $COMPRESSED_FILE

      - name: Upload encrypted backup
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: encrypted-db-backup
          path: $ENCRYPTED_FILE
          retention-days: 7

      - name: Cleanup unencrypted files
        run: |
          shred -u $BACKUP_FILE
          shred -u $COMPRESSED_FILE

  process-backup:
    needs: create-backup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download encrypted backup
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: encrypted-db-backup

      - name: Decrypt backup
        run: |
          gpg --decrypt \
              --batch \
              --passphrase "$ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE" \
              --output $COMPRESSED_FILE \
              $ENCRYPTED_FILE

      - name: Extract backup
        run: tar -xzvf $COMPRESSED_FILE

      - name: Verify backup integrity
        run: |
          if [ -f "$BACKUP_FILE" ]; then
            echo "Backup file exists and is valid"
            BACKUP_SIZE=$(du -h $BACKUP_FILE | cut -f1)
            echo "Backup size: $BACKUP_SIZE"
          else
            echo "Error: Backup file not found"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Upload to secure storage
        run: |
          aws s3 cp $BACKUP_FILE s3://${{ secrets.BACKUP_BUCKET }}/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/ \
            --sse aws:kms \
            --sse-kms-key-id ${{ secrets.KMS_KEY_ID }}

      - name: Cleanup files
        run: |
          shred -u $BACKUP_FILE
          shred -u $COMPRESSED_FILE
          shred -u $ENCRYPTED_FILE
```

## Alternative Approach Using OpenSSL

```yaml
name: Large File Encryption with OpenSSL
on: [workflow_dispatch]

env:
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: ${{ secrets.FILE_ENCRYPTION_KEY }}
  INPUT_FILE: 'large-data-file.csv'
  ENCRYPTED_FILE: 'data.csv.enc'
  DECRYPTED_FILE: 'data-restored.csv'

jobs:
  encrypt-file:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Encrypt file
        run: |
          openssl enc -aes-256-cbc \
            -salt \
            -in $INPUT_FILE \
            -out $ENCRYPTED_FILE \
            -pass pass:$ENCRYPTION_KEY \
            -pbkdf2

      - name: Upload encrypted file
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: encrypted-data-file
          path: $ENCRYPTED_FILE

  process-file:
    needs: encrypt-file
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download encrypted file
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: encrypted-data-file

      - name: Decrypt file
        run: |
          openssl enc -aes-256-cbc \
            -d \
            -in $ENCRYPTED_FILE \
            -out $DECRYPTED_FILE \
            -pass pass:$ENCRYPTION_KEY \
            -pbkdf2

      - name: Verify file
        run: |
          file $DECRYPTED_FILE
          wc -l $DECRYPTED_FILE
```

## Best Practices for Large Files

1. **Chunking Very Large Files**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Split and encrypt large file
     run: |
       split -b 500M huge-file.bin huge-file-part.
       for part in huge-file-part.*; do
         gpg --symmetric --passphrase "$ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE" $part
       done
   ```

2. **Parallel Processing**:
   ```yaml
   strategy:
     matrix:
       chunk: [0, 1, 2, 3]
   steps:
     - name: Process chunk ${{ matrix.chunk }}
       run: |
         openssl enc -aes-256-cbc \
           -in file-part-${{ matrix.chunk }} \
           -out file-part-${{ matrix.chunk }}.enc \
           -pass pass:$ENCRYPTION_KEY
   ```

3. **Secure Cleanup**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Securely wipe temporary files
     run: |
       shred -u sensitive-file.txt
       shred -u sensitive-file.txt.enc
   ```

These examples demonstrate practical approaches to handling large file encryption/decryption in GitHub Actions while maintaining security and efficiency. The patterns can be adapted for various use cases like database backups, media processing, or sensitive data transfers.

# GitHub Token Secret & Permission Customization in GitHub Actions

Here's a comprehensive guide to using and customizing the `GITHUB_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions workflows, based on the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

## Understanding GITHUB_TOKEN

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is:
- Automatically created for each workflow run
- Authenticated with permissions to interact with your repository
- Automatically expired when the workflow completes

## Default Permissions

By default, `GITHUB_TOKEN` has:
- Read access to all scopes
- Write access to contents, issues, and pull requests

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Basic Workflow with Default Permissions

```yaml
name: Issue Auto-Labeler
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  label-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Add 'triage' label
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.addLabels({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.payload.issue.number,
              labels: ['triage']
            })
```

### Example 2: Customizing Token Permissions at Workflow Level

```yaml
name: Protected Branch Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

# Set custom permissions for all jobs
permissions:
  contents: write  # Needed to commit version updates
  pull-requests: read
  issues: none     # Explicitly disable access

jobs:
  version-update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Update version file
        run: |
          echo "1.2.3" > VERSION
          git config --global user.name "GitHub Actions"
          git config --global user.email "actions@github.com"
          git add VERSION
          git commit -m "Update version to 1.2.3"
          git push

      # This would fail because we disabled issues access
      - name: Try to create issue (will fail)
        if: false  # Disabled but shows example
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: 'New issue',
              body: 'This should fail'
            })
```

### Example 3: Job-Specific Permissions

```yaml
name: Multi-Stage Deployment

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build artifacts
        run: ./build.sh

      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: deployment-package
          path: dist/

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      deployments: write
    steps:
      - name: Download artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: deployment-package

      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy.sh

      - name: Create deployment status
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.repos.createDeployment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              ref: context.ref,
              environment: 'production',
              auto_merge: false,
              required_contexts: []
            })
```

### Example 4: Fine-Grained Permission Control

```yaml
name: Repository Maintenance

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday

permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Clean up old branches
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            // Get all branches
            const { data: branches } = await github.rest.repos.listBranches({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo
            })

            // Delete merged branches older than 30 days
            for (const branch of branches) {
              if (branch.name !== 'main') {
                const { data: prs } = await github.rest.pulls.list({
                  owner: context.repo.owner,
                  repo: context.repo.repo,
                  state: 'closed',
                  base: branch.name
                })

                if (prs.length > 0 && prs[0].merged_at) {
                  const mergedDate = new Date(prs[0].merged_at)
                  const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date()
                  thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30)

                  if (mergedDate < thirtyDaysAgo) {
                    await github.rest.git.deleteRef({
                      owner: context.repo.owner,
                      repo: context.repo.repo,
                      ref: `heads/${branch.name}`
                    })
                  }
                }
              }
            }

  stale-issues:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: none  # Explicitly disable
    steps:
      - name: Mark stale issues
        uses: actions/stale@v8
        with:
          days-before-stale: 60
          days-before-close: 7
          stale-issue-message: 'This issue has been inactive for 60 days. It will be closed in 7 days unless updated.'
          stale-issue-label: 'stale'
```

## Available Permission Scopes

Here are the key permission scopes you can control:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `actions` | GitHub Actions access |
| `checks` | Check suites and runs |
| `contents` | Repository contents |
| `deployments` | Deployments |
| `id-token` | OIDC token permissions |
| `issues` | Issues |
| `discussions` | Discussions |
| `packages` | GitHub Packages |
| `pages` | GitHub Pages |
| `pull-requests` | Pull requests |
| `repository-projects` | Projects |
| `security-events` | Security events |
| `statuses` | Commit statuses |

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions
2. **Workflow-Level Defaults**: Set baseline permissions at workflow level
3. **Job-Specific Overrides**: Increase permissions only where needed
4. **Explicit Disabling**: Use `none` for scopes you want to explicitly deny
5. **Audit Logs**: Monitor token usage in your audit logs

These examples demonstrate practical implementations of `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission customization for common scenarios like automated labeling, deployment workflows, and repository maintenance.
