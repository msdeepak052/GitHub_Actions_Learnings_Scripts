# GitHub Actions: Timeout Minutes & Continue on Error Explained

## Timeout Minutes

The `timeout-minutes` setting specifies the maximum number of minutes a job or step is allowed to run before GitHub automatically cancels it. This helps prevent jobs from running indefinitely due to hangs or other issues.

## Continue on Error

The `continue-on-error` setting determines whether a workflow should continue running when a step fails. By default (false), a step failure stops the workflow. When set to true, the workflow continues even if that step fails.

## Complete Example (Non-NPM, Non-Matrix)

Here's a practical example using a Python script and system commands:

```yaml
name: System Operations Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  system-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15  # Entire job will timeout after 15 minutes
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Run disk check (allowed to fail)
      continue-on-error: true
      run: |
        df -h
        du -sh .
        
    - name: Run long operation with timeout
      timeout-minutes: 5  # This specific step times out after 5 minutes
      run: |
        echo "Starting resource-intensive operation..."
        # Simulate a long-running process
        sleep 300
        echo "This line won't be reached if sleep takes more than 5 minutes"
        
    - name: Critical system check
      run: |
        free -m
        nproc
        
    - name: Run Python script (allowed to fail)
      continue-on-error: true
      run: |
        python3 -c "
        print('Starting Python operation')
        # This would fail if python3 isn't available
        import missing_module  # This will fail
        "
        
    - name: Final cleanup
      run: echo "Cleanup completed"
```

## ðŸ§ª Real-World Example: Deploy & Notify

### ðŸŽ¯ Scenario:

We are building a Java application, and then deploying it. We also want to send a Slack notification **even if the deploy step fails**.

```yaml
name: Java CI with Timeout and Error Control

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10  # This job must complete within 10 minutes

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'

      - name: Build Java app
        run: |
          echo "Building the app..."
          sleep 5
          echo "Build complete"

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 2  # Deployment should not exceed 2 minutes

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to test server
        run: |
          echo "Deploying app..."
          sleep 180  # Simulating a long-running step (3 min)
        continue-on-error: true  # Even if this fails due to timeout, go to next step

      - name: Notify Slack (always run)
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "Notifying Slack (even if deployment failed)..."
```

---

### âœ… Output:

* The **`deploy`** step will timeout in 2 minutes and fail.
* But due to `continue-on-error: true`, it **wonâ€™t stop the workflow**.
* The `Notify Slack` step will **still run**.

## Key Points:

1. The entire `system-checks` job will timeout after 15 minutes (`timeout-minutes` at job level)
2. The "Run long operation with timeout" step has its own 5-minute timeout
3. Both "Run disk check" and "Run Python script" steps have `continue-on-error: true` so the workflow continues even if they fail
4. If any other step fails, the workflow will stop (default behavior)

## Official Documentation References:

- [Timeout minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes)
- [Continue on error](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepscontinue-on-error)

The example demonstrates these concepts with system operations rather than npm or matrix configurations, showing how you can apply these settings to any type of workflow.
