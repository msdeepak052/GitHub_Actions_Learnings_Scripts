# GitHub Actions Status Check Functions Explained with Real-World Examples

Status check functions in GitHub Actions let you evaluate the success or failure of previous jobs or steps in your workflow. Here's a comprehensive explanation with real-world examples based on the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/evaluate-expressions-in-workflows-and-actions#status-check-functions).

## Key Status Check Functions

1. **`success()`** - Returns `true` when all previous steps have succeeded
2. **`always()`** - Runs regardless of previous step status
3. **`cancelled()`** - Returns `true` if workflow was cancelled
4. **`failure()`** - Returns `true` if any previous step failed

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Deployment with Notifications

```yaml
name: Deployment Pipeline
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Build application
        run: ./build.sh
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: ./run-tests.sh
        
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        if: success()
        run: ./deploy.sh --env staging
        
  notify:
    needs: [build, deploy]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Notify success
        if: success()
        run: ./notify-slack.sh "Deployment succeeded!"
        
      - name: Notify failure
        if: failure()
        run: ./notify-slack.sh "Deployment failed! Check logs"
        
      - name: Cleanup resources
        if: always()
        run: ./cleanup-resources.sh
```

### Example 2: Conditional Database Migration

```yaml
name: Database Migration
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: 'Force migration even if tests fail'
        required: false
        default: 'false'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run database tests
        run: ./test-database.sh
        
  migrate:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run normal migration
        if: success() || github.event.inputs.force == 'true'
        run: ./run-migration.sh
        
      - name: Log forced migration
        if: failure() && github.event.inputs.force == 'true'
        run: echo "WARNING: Migration forced despite test failures"
```

### Example 3: Cleanup After Cancelled Workflow

```yaml
name: Resource Provisioning
on: [workflow_dispatch]

jobs:
  provision:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Allocate cloud resources
        run: ./provision-resources.sh
        
      - name: Configure resources
        run: ./configure-resources.sh
        
  cleanup:
    needs: provision
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Normal cleanup
        if: success()
        run: ./standard-cleanup.sh
        
      - name: Cancellation cleanup
        if: cancelled()
        run: ./emergency-cleanup.sh
        
      - name: Failure cleanup
        if: failure()
        run: ./diagnostic-cleanup.sh
```

### Example 4: Multi-Stage Approval Process

```yaml
name: Production Deployment
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      approve:
        description: 'Approve deployment'
        required: true
        type: boolean

jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run security scan
        run: ./security-scan.sh
        
      - name: Run performance tests
        run: ./performance-test.sh
        
  approval:
    needs: checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check approval
        if: github.event.inputs.approve != 'true'
        run: exit 1
        
      - name: Log approval
        if: github.event.inputs.approve == 'true'
        run: echo "Deployment approved by ${{ github.actor }}"
        
  deploy:
    needs: [checks, approval]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        if: success()
        run: ./deploy-prod.sh
        
      - name: Rollback if needed
        if: failure()
        run: ./rollback.sh
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dependency Control**: Use `needs` to establish job dependencies
2. **Success Handling**: `success()` ensures steps only run when previous steps succeed
3. **Failure Handling**: `failure()` lets you implement error recovery
4. **Cleanup**: `always()` ensures cleanup runs regardless of status
5. **Cancellation**: `cancelled()` helps handle interrupted workflows
6. **Combining Conditions**: You can mix status checks with other expressions

These examples demonstrate how to build robust workflows that properly handle success, failure, and cancellation scenarios in real-world CI/CD pipelines, database operations, and infrastructure management.
