# Uploading and Downloading Job Artifacts in GitHub Actions

Artifacts allow you to persist files after a job completes and share data between jobs in a workflow. Unlike caches, artifacts are retained after the workflow completes and can be downloaded manually.

## Uploading Artifacts

Use the `actions/upload-artifact` action to save files:

### Basic Example
```yaml
- name: Upload build artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: path/to/files/
```

### Multiple Files Example
```yaml
- name: Upload multiple artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: |
      path/to/file1
      path/to/file2
      path/to/folder/
```

### Conditional Upload
```yaml
- name: Upload on failure
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: error-logs
    path: logs/
```

## Downloading Artifacts

Use `actions/download-artifact` to retrieve files in subsequent jobs:

### Basic Download
```yaml
- name: Download artifact
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
```

### Specific Path Download
```yaml
- name: Download to specific directory
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: custom/path/
```

## Artifact Retention

Artifacts are retained for:
- **90 days** for public repositories
- **90 days** for private repositories on free plans
- Custom retention periods available for GitHub Enterprise

## Artifact Limits

| Limit Type              | Value                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Individual artifact size | 10 GB (GitHub Enterprise: configurable) |
| Total storage per repo  | Depends on account type  |
| Upload timeout          | 6 hours                  |

## Complete Workflow Example

```yaml
name: 26. Build and Deploy
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering of the workflow

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Build
      run: |
        mkdir -p build/
        echo "Built at $(date)" > build/output.txt
        
    - name: Upload build artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: build-output
        path: build/
    
    - name: view build output
      run: |
        ls -l build/
        cat build/output.txt

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: view build directory in deploy
      continue-on-error: true  # Continue even if the build directory doesn't exist
      run: |
        ls -l build/

    - name: Download artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: build-output
        path: build/  # Specify the same path used when uploading
        
    - name: Show artifact contents
      run: |
        ls -lrt
        ls -l build/
        cat build/output.txt
```

## Here's a detailed explanation of the key parameters used with GitHub Actions artifacts (for both **upload** and **download** operations):

---

### **1. Uploading Artifacts (`actions/upload-artifact@v4`)**

| Parameter       | Required | Description                                                                 | Example                          |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `name`         | Yes      | Unique name for the artifact (used to download later)                       | `name: build-output`             |
| `path`         | Yes      | File/directory path to upload (supports globs and multiple lines)           | `path: dist/` or `path: *.log`   |
| `if-no-files-found` | No   | Behavior when no files match `path`:<br>`warn` (default), `error`, `ignore` | `if-no-files-found: error`       |
| `retention-days` | No    | Override default 90-day retention (Enterprise only)                         | `retention-days: 5`              |
| `compression-level` | No  | ZIP compression level (0-9, default 6)                                  | `compression-level: 9`           |
| `overwrite`    | No       | Overwrite existing artifact (default `false`)                              | `overwrite: true`                |

#### **Upload Example:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-app-build
    path: |
      dist/
      *.log
    if-no-files-found: error
    compression-level: 9
```

Here's a detailed explanation of the **`if-no-files-found`** parameter for `actions/upload-artifact@v4`:

---

### **`if-no-files-found` Parameter**
Controls what happens when the `path` you specified doesn't match any files during artifact upload.

#### **Options:**
| Value    | Behavior                                                                 | Use Case                                                                 |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `warn`   | (Default) Logs a warning but continues the workflow. Artifact is empty.  | When missing files aren't critical to your workflow.                     |
| `error`  | Fails the step immediately with an error.                                | When you **require** files to exist (e.g., build outputs must be present). |
| `ignore` | Silently continues without uploading anything.                           | When you want to suppress all warnings/errors about missing files.       |

---

### **Examples**

#### 1. Default (`warn`):
```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: logs
    path: non-existent-dir/*.log
    # No need to specify `if-no-files-found` (defaults to 'warn')
```
**Result:**  
⚠️ Warning in logs, but workflow continues. No artifact is created.

---

#### 2. Strict Mode (`error`):
```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-output
    path: dist/
    if-no-files-found: error  # Fails if 'dist/' is empty/missing
```
**Result:**  
❌ Fails the job if `dist/` doesn't exist or is empty. Useful to catch build failures early.

---

#### 3. Silent Mode (`ignore`):
```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: optional-files
    path: maybe-exists/*.tmp
    if-no-files-found: ignore  # No warnings/errors
```
**Result:**  
No output if files are missing. Workflow continues silently.

---

### **Key Notes:**
1. **Empty Artifacts**: With `warn` or `ignore`, an empty artifact is **not** created (unlike earlier versions of the action).
2. **Exit Codes**:  
   - `error`: Returns exit code `1` (fails the job).  
   - `warn`/`ignore`: Returns exit code `0` (success).
3. **Debugging**: Use `ls` before upload to verify files:
   ```yaml
   - run: ls -R path/to/files/
   ```

---

### **When to Use Each Option**
| Scenario                          | Recommended Setting |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Build outputs (must exist)        | `error`             |
| Logs (optional)                   | `warn`              |
| Cleanup/temporary files           | `ignore`            |

This parameter helps make your workflows more robust by explicitly handling missing files.
---

### **2. Downloading Artifacts (`actions/download-artifact@v4`)**

| Parameter       | Required | Description                                                                 | Example                          |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `name`         | No*      | Name of the artifact to download (required unless using `pattern`/`github_token`) | `name: build-output`        |
| `path`         | No       | Target download directory (default: workspace root)                         | `path: downloaded-artifacts/`    |
| `pattern`      | No       | Wildcard pattern to filter artifacts (e.g., `*-build`)                      | `pattern: '*-build'`            |
| `merge-multiple` | No    | Merge multiple matched artifacts into `path` (default `false`)              | `merge-multiple: true`           |
| `github_token` | No       | Custom token for cross-workflow downloads                                   | `github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` |

> **Note**: Either `name` or `pattern` is required.

#### **Download Examples:**

**By name:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-app-build
    path: artifacts/
```

**Using a pattern:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    pattern: '*-build'
    path: merged-artifacts/
    merge-multiple: true
```

### **Key Scenarios & Best Practices**

1. **Multiple Files/Directories**  
   Use `|` for multi-line paths:
   ```yaml
   path: |
     bin/
     *.log
     config.yml
   ```

2. **Dynamic Artifact Names**  
   Use GitHub context variables:
   ```yaml
   name: build-${{ github.run_id }}
   ```

3. **Matrix Builds**  
   Distinguish artifacts per job:
   ```yaml
   name: build-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.node-version }}
   ```

4. **Cross-Workflow Downloads**  
   Requires `github_token` and explicit permissions:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     actions: read  # Needed for cross-workflow downloads
   ```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Name artifacts clearly** for easy identification
2. **Compress large files** before uploading
3. **Use matrix builds** with unique artifact names
4. **Clean up old artifacts** to stay within storage limits
5. **Split large artifacts** if approaching size limits
