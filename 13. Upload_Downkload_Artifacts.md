# Uploading and Downloading Job Artifacts in GitHub Actions

Artifacts allow you to persist files after a job completes and share data between jobs in a workflow. Unlike caches, artifacts are retained after the workflow completes and can be downloaded manually.

## Uploading Artifacts

Use the `actions/upload-artifact` action to save files:

### Basic Example
```yaml
- name: Upload build artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: path/to/files/
```

### Multiple Files Example
```yaml
- name: Upload multiple artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: |
      path/to/file1
      path/to/file2
      path/to/folder/
```

### Conditional Upload
```yaml
- name: Upload on failure
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: error-logs
    path: logs/
```

## Downloading Artifacts

Use `actions/download-artifact` to retrieve files in subsequent jobs:

### Basic Download
```yaml
- name: Download artifact
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
```

### Specific Path Download
```yaml
- name: Download to specific directory
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-artifact
    path: custom/path/
```

## Artifact Retention

Artifacts are retained for:
- **90 days** for public repositories
- **90 days** for private repositories on free plans
- Custom retention periods available for GitHub Enterprise

## Artifact Limits

| Limit Type              | Value                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Individual artifact size | 10 GB (GitHub Enterprise: configurable) |
| Total storage per repo  | Depends on account type  |
| Upload timeout          | 6 hours                  |

## Complete Workflow Example

```yaml
name: 26. Build and Deploy
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering of the workflow

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Build
      run: |
        mkdir -p build/
        echo "Built at $(date)" > build/output.txt
        
    - name: Upload build artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: build-output
        path: build/
    
    - name: view build output
      run: |
        ls -l build/
        cat build/output.txt

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: view build directory in deploy
      continue-on-error: true  # Continue even if the build directory doesn't exist
      run: |
        ls -l build/

    - name: Download artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: build-output
        path: build/  # Specify the same path used when uploading
        
    - name: Show artifact contents
      run: |
        ls -lrt
        ls -l build/
        cat build/output.txt
```

## Best Practices

1. **Name artifacts clearly** for easy identification
2. **Compress large files** before uploading
3. **Use matrix builds** with unique artifact names
4. **Clean up old artifacts** to stay within storage limits
5. **Split large artifacts** if approaching size limits
